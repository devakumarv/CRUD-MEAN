## CRUD operations using MEAN stack
This repository helps in creating CRUD operations—Create, Read, Update, and Delete which are fundamental to managing data in such applications, using the MEAN stack, comprising MongoDB, Express.js, Angular, and Node.js

## Pre-Requisites  
* Install Node.js and Node Package manager by following the steps mentioned in the below link:  https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm#using-a-node-installer-to-install-nodejs-and-npm.
  
* Also, create an account on MongoDB using the below link   https://account.mongodb.com/account/login

* There’s no installation procedure for Angular JS, we can  use a CDN to access the files from a globally distributed network of servers. Just include the below script tag in the html file
   <script src="http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/angularjs/1.3.14/angular.min.js"></script>

* W3 schools website - https://www.w3schools.com/angular/default.asp is a good place to learn Angular JS
  
* After successfully installing Node.js and npm, you can do **npm init** in the directory you're going to work. It initializes a package.json file containing metadata about the project and its dependencies. 

* Packages to be installed with npm : 
  * **Express JS** - npm install express
    * This is a fast, unopinionated, minimalist web framework for Node.js. It simplifies the process of building web applications and APIs, making it easier to handle routes, requests, and responses.
  * **EJS** - npm install ejs
    * EJS is a simple templating language that lets you generate HTML markup with plain JavaScript. It allows you to embed JavaScript code within your HTML, making it easier to dynamically generate content on the server side.
  * **Express Handlebars** - npm install express-handlebars
    * This is another templating engine for Express. Handlebars provide a more logic-driven approach to templating, allowing you to create reusable templates with dynamic content.
  * **Mongoose** - npm install mongoose
    * Mongoose is an Object Data Modeling (ODM) library for MongoDB and Node.js. It provides a higher-level abstraction for interacting with MongoDB, allowing you to define schemas, perform queries, and manage relationships in a more structured way.
  * **Nodemon** - npm install nodemon
    * Nodemon is a utility that monitors for changes in your Node.js application and automatically restarts the server. It's a great tool for development, as it saves you from manually stopping and restarting the server every time you make changes to your code.
